5,8,One Column,"Digijeunes was set up in response to a perceived lack of non-formal educational activities targeting youngsters and tackling digital media and latest digital technologies. We believe youth workers and youth organizations should play an important role in encouraging youngsters to employ digital medi and technologies in ways that promote their personal and professional growth, both in formal and non-formal educational contexts. Our activities are built around two axis: a) ensure that children an adolescents have access to latest media and digital technologies; b) trigger reflection, debate, critic analysis of these new forms of interaction with people and the environment. Digijeunes also originated in reaction to the growing place that DIY and participatory culture occupies in our communities. We believe these phenomena are highly valuable and deserve promotion in so far as they tend to foster communitarism and reduce negative reflexes such as compulsive consumerism challenges, Trade events, digital fabrication festivals, etc. Thus, digijeunes.com serves as intermediary between organizations and institutions active in the domain of digital mediation and th target public. It also serves to consolidate their network and mutually enrich their practices. The people who are at the origin of this venture have an extensive experience in different domains spanning from social work to public policy consulting.

30,101,One Column,"around the world, across a range of instructional environments, including libraries, museums, independent non profit and for profit organizations, lower education and higher education institutio Educators, teachers, and youth workers have been stressing the positive impact of maker educati on youth , notably they have been underlining the fact that it allows youngsters to grow into responsible consumers, capable of crafting their own technological gadgets instead of just consuming them, that it enable them to connect with school disciplines in such a a way as to make the latter more meaningful, also that it gives them new perspectives on every day experiences by triggering their curiosity for exploring familiar phenomena, as well as less familar ones. Typically, maker education relies on tools such as programming softwares, tailored specifically to suit the needs of youth, electronic prototytping board that allows users to craft ambitious interactive projec cnc machines that enable users to create anything they can think of and design. At the outset of its growth in popularity, maker education promised to democratize access to the discourses of power that accompany becoming a producer of artifacts, especially when those artifacts use twenty-first- century technologies. In fact, maker education is an ofshoot of the maker movement, whose philosophy promotes values such as open source, and participation of all regardless their background or areas of interest. However, contrariwise to these expectations, it appears that mak education tends to exclude minorities and certain groups of people from benefiting from it. For one thing, the tools typically employed in maker education as pedagogical supports, are not generally found to appeal to a female audience, who may be somewhat intimidated by items such as cnc machines and electronic components, or programming softwares. In attempting to democratize maker education and ensuring that all learnes have the opportunity to engage with it, educators an teachers have come up with several strategies. To date, efforts to build girl inclusive maker workshops have largely revolved around two major efforts: (a) keeping male and female youth/children separated in STEM-related classes or clubs and (b) encouraging female youth/children to play with “boys’” toys and tools. Another more promising avenue, and the one we wish to explore with this youth workers training, is the one consisting in rendering the pedagogical supports employed in maker workshops more appealing to female youth. It is believed that e-textil yields the potential to do so. An electronic textile refers to a textile substrate that incorporates capabilities for sensing (biometric or external), communication (usually wireless), power transmission, and interconnection technology to allow sensors or things such as information twisted and incorporate some amount of conductive material (such as strands of silver or stainless steel) to enable electrical conductivity. Research indicates that educational practices embedding e textiles offer opportunities for girls to literally take “hands-on” leadership roles. Ultimately, they garments and accessories embedding technological gadgets such as microcontrollers, sensors an actuators. This should empower them to lead girl inclusive maker workshops in their own professional settings, thus ultimately, contributing to the democratization and further promotion of educatoinal strand. The overall quality of youth work shall also improve via integration of innovativ working methods centered around ICT. The second mobility activity in purposely taking place in Romania, and one of the activites planned in this context is the visit of the village of Calarasi, wher textile factories owned by Western European brands (ex. H&M, Emporio Armani, Max Mara) have been relocating for the past two decades or so. With this action, we will be placing the training course within a broader context. Participants will be able to discover the typical ansewer of the maker and DIY movement to issues pertainting to industrial manufacturing and its curent trends. The ultimate goal is to invite participants to adopt, whenever possible, an holisitc approach to running activities with their target public in the context of youth work, thus attributing them extra sense and meaning ICT. Although they may not have an extensive experience in leading training courses and seminars on these topics, some of their members will nonetheless be able to act as facilitators. Their technica competence and in depth knowledge of the subject matter will prove pivotal at the stage of planning of the project activities, especially the practical hands-on tasks. Moreover, the organizatio is already familiar with public events on digital and maker culture in their country, which might represent opportunities to disseminate the results of the project and enhance visibility of the mobilit activities. Exploring sense is very much active in the field of digital mediation. They have alread with a young audience (on electornic music, on digital arts). Members of exploring sense will be abl to inform the agenda for the two mobilities and suggest facilitatiion stechniques for the practical activities. exploring sense will be able to exchange on good practices and success stories on AND THEIR LEVEL OF RELIABILITY YIA and ActArt have successfully led and/or participated in E project in the past on a variety of different topics. They will be able to support the coordinatin gorganization with logistical and practical matters related to implementaiton of the mobility activites (ex. arrange arrivals/departures of participants, determingin pre arrival preparatory tasks, suggest follow-up activities) . They will also be able to support digijeunes at the stage of recruting participan for the two mobility activites. Their expertise on E+ projects will be something worth sharing wit organization that are newer to this area (ex. exploring sense, Arduino Albania), at some stage durin the training courses. 3) THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESULTS O THE TRAINING, THEIR DISSEMINATION CAPACITY - Horizon Lab and exploring sense and arduino albania, will gain in strength and visibility in the domain in which they operate by cooperatin on an international venture with other organizations active in the field of digital mediation. They will lead future training course targeting youth practitioners. - Exploring sense is planning to launch makerspace in Brighton by the end of 2017; their experinece on this project shall help them with the this intiative shall widen the perspectives for future growth of the makerspace. Conversely, the popularity of the mkarspace shall contirbute to promiting the results of this project. - Arduino Albani unemployment rates. On the other hand, young people generally have higher education diplomas, a very high number of graduates stuends is also resident in that area. Mobility opportunities such as the present KA1 youth workers training are expected to impact the local youth to the extent that it w reactivate them from a professional point of view. Horizon Lab also needs to increase membership and boost participation to its activities; the organization will capitalize on this experience to learn fro more experienced youth work, and to develop their own non-formal learning methodology to improv participation in this mobility project is part of the community's efforts to open up to international cooperations. as a result of this experience, they shall be able to benefit to a greater extent from knowlege on pedagogical aspects of digital mediation (ex. to target widen audience): contact and exchange with the facilitaotrs at the trianing course will inspire them to do so. YIA and ActArt needs to widen their offer in terms of youth work activities, notably by incorporating ICT-based practices.",,1
33,114,One Column,"Creativity and culture ICT - new technologies - digital competences New innovative curricula/educational methods/development of training courses Participants profiles will be very much diversified. There will be experienced youth workers who recognize the importance of engaging in practices involving new technologies but struggle to embrace them, youth workers who are secure about their skills and have experience adapting to ne youth workers who are active users of and already experiment new technologies, interested in sharing new styles of work ; finally pioneers in the use and experimentation of new technologies (especially in the domain of electronic prototyping and computer coding), but lacking sufficient experience and knowledge of youth work to engage in activities with youngsters on the topics they are passionate about. We will also attempt to mix particpants affiliated to maker communities/places both their colleagues who already have a considerable experience in the domain of digital youth work, and from technicians and technology specialists. Participants will not necessarily be recruited from within partner and coordinating organizations. All participating organizations will be able to forward call for participation to their professional networks. Some participants have already been pr selected, notably the facilitators who will be incharge of leading certain activities. Participation will b also open to N.E.E.Ts who are willing to reintegrate the field of youth work or experiment this career for the first time, either as volunteer or employees. In selecting participants, priority will be given to: - youth workers who do not yet possess the necessary skills to tackle topics from the domain of digita science with their public - those struggling to capture youth attention, especially with regards technical educational activities. - those who wish to ensure a longer-term impact of their work on the digital and media education - those who are requested by their organizations/institutions or by partner organizations/institutions to lead activities on digital technologies in the future Each participating organization will issue a call for participants (internal to their organizations as well as within their professional networks, via their wbesite, social networks, e-mail, face to face contacts form set up by the coordinating organization). Additionally, a call for participants will also be published on salto-youth by the coordinating organization, as well as on the on-line platform pages. All applications from propsective candidates will be centralized by the coordianating organization which, aided by inputs from the participating organizations, will operate the final seletion, at least 2 months ahead of the first mobility activity. We will attempt to have the same individuals participate to both mobilty activities. In fact, the two activites are very much connected insofar as one is the logical continuation of the other (whereas the first activity is a focus on e-textile for youth work purposes, the second serves to place this practice within a broader framework of constructivist teaching methods and the maker movement and culture).",,1
35,121,One Column,"For both mobility activities, the minimum age for participants will be 18 years old. there will be no upper age limit. The large age span will guarantee a gap in level of digital competences and familiarity of participants with digital youth work methods and techniques. We will value diversity in terms of age and genre. This said we will encourage partner organizations to recruit female participants, in view of contributing to fighting the stereotype according to which women are less prone to engage in technical disciplines than man. The facilitators will make sure that all participants can make an equal contribution to the training. If need be, they will encourage participants to state their minds openly.",,1

They shall consequently be able to overcome received ideas abo the digital world, its expansion, and its future development and impact on society. - Familiarize with computational thinking. This will help them make light work of difficult problems - development of a maker mindset. Such attitude is expected to bring educational and professional benefits. In fact, a maker mindset empowers young people to perform better in STEM and related disciplines and also in creating their own jobs and occupations, depending on their interests and the emerging needs th see in a rapidly changing society - in the process of creating, youngsters seek information in order t most representative of the day, for example, satisfaction, frustration, motivation, disappointment, et This allows to monitor the emotional response of participants to each activity of the training. - 8 KEY COMPETENCES: we will display 8 posters, one for each key competence mentioned in the Youthpass. Participants will be able to fill in each of these posters individually, at any time during th training. This will give participants enough time to gather their thoughts on the youthpass key competencies that they may acquire during the training. - COMPETENCES TRIANGLE: at the end each activity participants will be required to state which kind of knowledge they have acquired. The instruments to validate knowledge acquired in non-formal educational contexts. This will serve as a auto-evaluation tool for participants, a recognition of the work they will have accomplished. It will al guarantee the sustainability of the project results. The digital badges will gather some of the conten that will have been developed during the activities and will put this into the form of a user-friendly an accessible online tools for improving one's own skills on the topics of the project. Digital badges will anyone, provided only a free registration. Participants will rely on a canvass delivered by the coordinating organization to produce the digital badge. Thus, no programming nor web design skill will be required. The digital badges produced at the end of the mobility activity in France will be culture more generally. - KAHOOT QUIZZ: kahoot quizzes are interactive quizzes hosted on an on- line platform. They allow an indefinite number of people to take part to the quizz simultaneously, at any time, and regardless spatial constraints (people can simply access the quizz provided they are connected to the net. Participants will be invited to produce collectively a kahoot quizz at the end of most modules of the project activities. The quizz will focus on the content of the module and serve a an auto-evaluation tool.

Participants will acquire the necesary technical/practical knowledge and confidence to lead girl-inclusive workshops in their own professional settings, on the topic of e-textiles. Arduino enables us to upgrade clothing and accessories by embedding sensors and actuators connected to the board. Smart clothing and accessories obtained by integrating technology are called e-textiles. E-textile also refer to a textile substrate that incorporates capabilities for sensing (biometric or external), communication, power transmission, and interconnection technology to allow sensors or things such as information processing devices to be networked together within a fabric. 3. e-textile projects objectives - gain a first hand experience on project-based learning, in relation with e-textiles and wearable technologies - develop one’s ideas about the obstacles and opportunities connected with e-textiles workshops in a youth work setting - understand how practical activites on e-textiles can be used in the context of youth work to boost participation of young people, especially female participants. Via this module, participants will be able to face a number of obstacles typically associate with crafting e-textile projects. They will be able to put themselves in the perspective of youth who ma engage in this type of activity, thus ponder ways of circumventing these problems and ways to assist their young audience on future e-textile youth who engage in making activities - learn about practical tools to validate the learning outcomes of youth who engage in making activities Typically, teachers and educators find it very hard to assess and evaluate making activities. For one thing, the spirit of making activities consists in unleashing one's imagination and creativity to produce whatever gadgets one feels like. The issue with project-based learning is that guidelines for making activities are kept to a minimum, so that the final creations can hardly be evaluated against a system of pre-established standards. Teachers an educators confronted with this question have come up with provisional solutions. Nonetheless, The subject is still very much up to debate ACTIVITY 2, ROMANIA 5. introduction to constructivist teaching methods objectives : -exchange on ‘tinkering’ as an emerging pedagogical approach - exchange good practices related to implementatin of constructivist methods in youtH work settings Constructivist teaching is based on the belief that learning occurs as learners are actively involved in a process of meaning and knowledge construction as opposed to passively receiving information. Learners are the makers of meaning and knowledge. Constructivist approach applies both to formal and non-formal learning contexts. 6. meeting with the actors of the maker movement in Bucharest objectives: receive inputs from agents of the maker movement and learn about their initiatives pertaining to non-formal education targeting youth and adults 7. initiatives aiming to support the integration of the maker attitud in the field of education, ran at international scale objective: get practical insights into funding opportunities to set up educational making programmes and workshops 8. maker education in practice objective: experiment digital fabrication equipment to envisage yoth work activites on this topic.

OBA has already provided Digijeunes with an account that allows digijeunes to create badges and publish them on the platform, under the Digijeunes academy. DigitalMe has also provided Digijeunes with detailed guidelines as to how to go about producing a badge. Communication with city, and possibly the visit of the textile factory located in the area. During this training course, participants will be testing and debating a number of innovative tools in the field of e-textiles (ex. Eduwear toolkit), as well as assesment and evaluation tools conceived specifically for non formal education activites on making (ex. failure boxes). The owner of such items will be notified about any conclusion concerning these tools, reached during the training. Digijeunes is already in contact with the Dimeb (digital media in education) at the University of Bremen, to negotiate delivery of free eduwear kit samples to be employed as pedagogical supports during the training. Digijeunes is also in touch with the Laboral (centro de arte y creacion industrial), whose education department is reponsible for most of the innovative assessment techniques for making activites that we will be reviewing during our training course.",,1

93,229,One Column,"IMPACT ON PARTICIPANTS Participants will gain insights into educational activities on making an digital science, especially girl-inclusive workhsops focused on these topics. This, in turn, will impact their work in the following ways: - their professional practices will be richer as a result of introduction of new pedagogical tools - they will be able to appreciate risks and opportunities for youngsters, behind existing and future technologies - they will be able to better respond to their public needs especially when it comes to bridging the digital divide gap - they will be able to identify potential partnerships/collaborations with places and communities for the dissemination for digital/ make face the challenge of uneven opportunities when it comes to youth participation to digital/maker communities - participants will be more confident in adopting consructivist teaching methods for professional purposes - increased motivation to constantly innovate their professional practices insofar as the universe of digital technologies is itself subject to permanent evolution - participants further mobility projects - participants will develop a set of attributes which will be useful for personal and professional growth, especially given that ICT skills are highly demanded in all professional sectors IMPACT ON YOUNGSTERS (in the long term) By taking part in the training, participants wil acquire important skills and knowledge to lead activities based on a constructivist approach with the target public. Engaging in this type of activities entails a number of positive consequences for youngsters: - producing artifact (whether embedding electronic devices or not) often involve acting b trail and error. Exploration, experimentation, play, and collaboration with others are essential elements of the process. Consequently, youngsters also learn to learn. - knowledge happens remarkably well when learners build, make, and publicly share objects - youngsters will be able to rely on support of educators to approach and get involved in virtual or real communities of makers Participation to such communities could represent a powerful tool through which youth reactivates from a social, professional, educational point of view - youngsters experimenting constructivist learning methods will benefit form learning which is meaningful and contextualized IMPACT ON PARTICIPATING ORGANISATIONS Although members of Digijeunes have an extensive experience in youth work, the organization itself is relatively young and Digijeunes presently needs to extend its partnership at a local and international level. This project will provide future internationa opportunities and is also expected to improve the visibility and attractiveness of the organization locally (notably via gatherings of NGOs, European mobility forums, etc.). Digijeunes will take stock o technologies. It will also benefit from direct and in depth feedback about its practices/activities/ pedagogical methods. The same shall apply to all other partner organizations. Partner organizations will consolidate relations among each other, to operate more efficiently in the domain of internat cooperation. Partner organizations will envisage new kinds of youth initiatives in their countries, mainly on sustainable development, digital technologies and related topics. All participating organizations will be able to rely more heavily on participants for technical and pedagogical assistance concerning youth initiatives.",,1
94,233,One Column,"LOCAL/REGIONAL This mobility project shall inject novel ideas into the electronics and making workshops held by some of the partner organizations (ex. Exploring senses, Nod Makerspace, Arduino Albania) and promote this practice across their professional networks. Other participating orgazations with fewer expertise on this topic will be able to launch their own educational intaitives on pariticipation of local youth to mobility activities organized within the framework of Erasmus + Programme. In fact, the first and (so far) only Erasmus+ awareness raising event was held in Carcassonne in autumn 2016. Holding the second mobility activity in Bucharest has a strategic meaning. Romania hosts today several factories of western European brands (textiles, fashion industry, vehicles manufacture). The trip to Calarasi that is planned on the occasion of the mobility activity in Bucharest shall serve to trigger participants' reflection on the topic of relocating manufacture abroad where labor is cheaper, and shall also provide a trigger for debating such issues European countries (whether they are engaged in the maker movement locally or not). They may envisage partnerships together after this mobility project, or simply establish durable exchange between them. All in all, this should serve to add a positive note to the maker setting in Romania, and boost its growth. As a result of this mobility experience, thanks to the learning about digital mediation as well as means for the promotion of maker culture (ex. maker week, code week, hachaton, their own digital mediation events open to the general public, in the areas where they operate. This should result in overall greater permeability of the maker culture and knoweldge of the maker movement across Europe. Locally, the project shall also have an impact on policy makers. They shal be sensitized to the potential of ICT and making activities to reactivate youth, to the need of instructional environments, youth centres, etc. NATIONAL At the moment, there exist a few initaitive in France aimed at presenting digital technologies and e-textile from an educational point of view. Fo example, training courses for teachers/educators. These, however, very often require a remarkabl to be complementary to existing programmes, and provide the opporunity to youth workers from France and abroad to explore these topics for professional purposes, without having to commit substantial financial ressources of their own. We would also like to sensitize all pariticipating organizations and their respective professional networks (at national level) to the possibility of interfacing youth work with the maker communities, notably by running educational making workshops in places for digital and DIY culture (fablabs, makerspaces, etc.). Consequently participating organizations may initiate a new dynamic in their countries, whereby youth work will rely more heavily on the maker communities to innovate and improve the offer for non formal educational activities for a young audience. Additionally, participating organizations shall disseminate across their professional networks about the possibility of relying on EU funding to organize youth worker training courses; as a result, more initiatives of this kind (especialy on topics pertaining to digital youth work) shall crop up in their respective countries, in the future. EUROPEAN and INTERNATIONAL We would like to contribute to the generation of a network for digital youth worker across Europe. To this end, Digijeunes is currenlty in touch with organizing committes of previous work-, traing course in Warsaw -IT tools in non formal education of young people-). As the outputs of the training as well as resources that will be produced will be available without restrictions on several on-line platforms (ex. Digijeunes.com, participating organization's social networks, OBA.com, salt youth.net), youth workers and educators internationally will have enough material at their disposal to multiply activities on e-textiles and targeting youngsters. This shall consequently impact youth work internationally, by encouraging the emergence of making workshop, especially girl-inclusive workhsops.",,1
96,241,One Column,"The targets of dissemination activities are youth workers/educators, educational institutions/organizations active in youth work and based in the participating organizations' countries as well as across Europe, instructional environments (museums, libraries, etc.), individuals (adults, families), research centres involved in digital education: Laboral (centro de arte y creacion industrial in Spain) and Dimeb (research group Digital Media in education, at the University of Bremen, DE) Youth workers will be reached in order to raise their awareness on the potential of e-textiles to support creation of girl inclusive making workshops. The main project output that will be disseminated is the documentation relative to production of the e-textiles projects undertaken by shall provide ideas for future activities targeting youth, to anyone interested in e-textiles and digita youth work. The documentation will be available on a number of platforms and social networks (som of which specifically geared towards youth work), namely: - Movilab, used mainly in France by organizations active in the field of digital mediation (ex. fablabs, makerspaces). - the participating organizations' websites - participating organizations ' facebook pages - Wikidebrouillards.com (used by youth workers affiliated to the national network Les petits débrouillards, across France) - salto- youth, section on tools - educational tool portal - instructables.com - some selected videos relating to the crafting of the e-textile project may be uploaded on youtube (Digijeuns'channel). Educational institutions, organizations active in youth work, and instructional environments, will be concerned by dissemination of projects' results, mainly in view of encouraging them to open up to new educational methods in youth work, in particular hands-on problem-based an project-based workshops involving digital technologies. They shall also be sensitized with regards the need for democratizing maker education and boost inclusion of female youth and other underrepresented minorities. The items that will be disseminated in this context are general information about the project supported by videos, photos, as well as the physical creations of participants (the e-textile projects). Laboral and Dimeb will be targeted by dissemination activities in view of sharing feedback on the tools for digital education developed by these two research centres (assessment and evaluation tools, and Eduwear kit, respectively). This target public will be reached via direct contact (e-mail, one to one communcation). Groups outside the professional network of participating organizations will be reached via public events gathering actors of the youth sector (formal and non formal, as well as more generally families and individuals): for example: - Open bidouille camp, Toulouse: yearly event on DIY and maker culture.on this occasion The public will also be informally introduced to the Erasmus + programme and its mobility opportunities for young people and youth practitioners - gatherings of organizations for non-formal and formal education (ex. Salon des ressources éducatives, in Toulouse and Montpellier, CSTI in Toulouse) - European code week (in all of the public, organized throughout Europe. The European code week event at the Fablab in Carcassonne in October 2016 is expected to gather over 100 people. - Fête de la science 2018: French nationa science festival taking place every year in October. Participation is open to all organizations involved in scientific mediation, including organization active in digital mediation. Digijeunes expect to engage over 150 people during this event. Additional dissemination channels cutting across all target groups are the following: -press releases (local newspaper where the participating organizations are based) Two articles on the on-line magazine Makery: one before the mobility activities (to recruit participants, to communicate about the project) another after the mobility activities (to preset its results).",,1
98,244,One Column,"questionnaire. For each task undertaken, participants will be asked to rate the following : - the support they received from the facilitators - the quality of the material and pedagogical tools deploy - the motivation to continue training on e textiles and ICT-based youth work - the extent to which th have learned something susceptible of enriching their professional practices in terms of theoretical and/or practical knowledge - the synergy of the group for that activity - they will be asked to identify any aspect of that activity they disliked and prescribe recommendations to improve it - the extent to which the activity was relevant to the purposes of the project - the extent to which the activity met their expectations The questionnaire will be submitted at two stages: the first time on the last day o the training, the second time after the training is completed. This will enable participants to suggest supplementary questions and/or different evaluation criteria in the meantime. The questionnaire wil be available on-line at freeonlinesurveys.com. Another way for participants to evaluate the mobility activities will be via the Trello platform set up for the programme. participants will be able to leave comments on specific modules of each activity, simply by targeting the Trello slot that's most releva (ex. arrival, practical workshops, etc.) Performance with respect to the expected deliverables evaluated via a number of criteria specified within the quality management plan. In particular, production of deliverables will be successful if: - at least one digital badge targeting young people o the topic of e-textiles will be ready for publication on the OBA website by the end of the second success of deliverables of the project, hence their degree of exploitation, once the mobility activitie will be terminated will be evaluated via the following methods: - number of views of the project craft by participants and uploaded on on-line platforms (makezin.com, instrutables.com, etc.) - number o young people undertaking the digital badge published on OBA - number of views of the videos on t e-textile projects uploaded on youtube Learning outcomes of participants: - We will be able to with youngsters once they will have returned to their respective countries. A higher level of confidence in the non-formal teaching of digital science, (e-textile, electronics, robotics) and related topics will indicate effective learning. participation of the partner organziations to any large scale initative (ex. Eu maker week) will also indicate that these entities have developed a positive attitude towards digital youth work and are ready to embrace it fully. - participants' interaction with local maker communities (whether for professional purposes or not) will be another indicator to measure the success of the project - Learning outcomes will be evaluated on the occasion of production of t e-textile projects. Although this will not give an image of individual learning outcomes (since these outputs will have been produced by groups or collectively), it will be possible to evaluate different groups and compare the results, assess their confidence in dealing with (hence also delivering in th future) hands-on, problem-based, project-based approach to learning. Finally, it will be possible to monitor participants learning outcomes daily via the tools described in section E.2. Evaluation of participants' performance with regards their ability to lead digital education workshops targeting youth will also occur on the occasion of another mobility programme we envisage to organize, abou one year after completion of this project. On that occasion, participants will be able to report on the strategies to lead educational workshops involving e-textiles or other digital tools, and exchange be practices to improve digital youth work further. Assessment of the project will concern the exchang with laboral and dimeb. The fact that throughout the project we will be employing tools issued from these two research centres is expected to be conducive to greater communication and cooperation interaction (for example to test or even prototype new pedagogical methods/tool in the are of digital education) between laboral and dimeb and digijeunes or any other participating organization.",,1

110,250,One Column,"For almost a decade, the maker movement has been making its own may into non-formal educatio Educators and researchers have been talking about the role of making activities in learning; they highlight the potential for project-based and hands-on approach to boost youth interest for inquiry and learning, to re-activate them from a social, psychological, professional point of view. One popular strand of making activities in the context of non formal education involve experimenting with computer programming, electronics, and robotics. Typically, girls are much less prone to participa in such initiatives than boys, mainly due to the negative stereotypes they nurture towards scientific and technical disciplines. Thus, the great promise of the maker movement to democratize access making as well as to its progressive spirit and philosophy are to be reconsidered in the face of evidence. If we believe that making activities and maker identities are crucial for empowerment, th it is our job to set up situations whereby all learners have the opportunity and will to engage. E- textiles promises to be the trojan horse that will enable girls to fully benefit from making activities a the maker movement. By combining fashion with electronic and computer programming, e-textiles offer female youth expanded access to materials and tools, resulting in opportunities to take on project leadership roles in highly technical areas. Project Objectives ● Innovate youth work by introducing new practices based on the combination of crafting textiles with computer programmin and electronics ● Exchange on tinkering as an emerging pedagogical approach, especially craftin e-textiles as a way to boost female participation in non formal educational activities ● Sensitize youth partake in a week-long training on e-textiles, in view of jumpstarting this practice in their own professional settings. The training will take place in France. The main activities of the course will be: - Introduction to electronic DIY for youth work purposes, via the Arduino open-source prototyping board - Introduction to e-textiles - Production of e-textiles projects, working in groups - Debate on how to assess making activities and monitor learning outcomes. Up-to-date tools and methods conceived specifically to serve this purpose will be presented and experimented. A second mobilit activity within the framework of this project will take place in Romania, where participants will continue to explore the practice of making in educational settings. At this stage, participants will: - Meet with the local maker community (Hatch hackerspace and Nod Makerspace, in Bucharest) - Learn about constructivist teaching methods (teaching methods based on hands on, immersive, participative approach, project based learning) - Explore initiatives aiming to support the integratio of the maker attitude in the field of education run at international scale - Practice maker education a makerspace/fablab setting - Discuss extra thoughts on building girl-inclusive maker workshops.",,1
110,251,One Column,"Learning Outcomes As a result of the training course participants will be able to: ● Get youngster involved in initiatives on electronic DIY, in particular about e-textiles ● Initiate and supervise activities targeting youth on the topics of e-textiles ● Identify and seize opportunities to constantly innovate youth workers’ professional practices ● Encourage female youth participation in educational activities on technical topics. Target public ● Anyone with a passion/interest in digital technologies, and interested in youth work ● Individuals active in the promotion of DIY and/or digi culture interested in running educational activities targeting young people ● Youth workers with a experience in non formal digital education or willing to launch educational workshops on this topic Youth workers seeking ways to boost participation of female youth in educational activities on ICT",,1
